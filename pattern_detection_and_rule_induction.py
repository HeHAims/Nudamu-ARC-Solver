# Phase 1: CognitiveReasoner Skeleton Code

```python
import numpy as np

class CognitiveReasoner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.long_term_memory = []  # Learned rules
        self.working_memory = []    # Current task state

    def solve(self, examples):
        """Induce simple mock rules and return a solution object."""
        # For Phase 1, we just store a mock rule
        rule = {"pattern": "mock_pattern", "action": "mock_action"}
        self.long_term_memory.append(rule)
        return rule

    def execute(self, solution, input_data):
        """Apply mock transformation."""
        # For math strings, eval as fallback (CAUTION: Phase 1 only, replace later)
        if isinstance(input_data, str):
            try:
                return str(eval(input_data))
            except Exception:
                return "error"
        # For grids, just return input as placeholder
        elif isinstance(input_data, np.ndarray):
            return input_data.copy()
        else:
            return input_data
```

### Phase 1 Goals:
- Establish class + memory structure âœ…
- Provide dummy solve + execute âœ…
- Ready for rule induction logic in Phase 2 âœ…

ðŸ‘‰ Let me know when to proceed to Phase 2!
